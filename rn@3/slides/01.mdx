# GraphQL

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs,
and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.
GraphQL was developed internally by Facebook in 2012
Before being publicly released in 2015.

```GraphQL
query {
  breakingNewses {
    id
    title
  }
  importantNewses {
    id
    title
  }
}
```
