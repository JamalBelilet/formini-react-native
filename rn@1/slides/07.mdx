# Components are functions that return JSX

- JSX looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript
- Inside of JSX use curly braces to contain JS
- A lot of people go "YUCK!" when they see HTML mixed into JS,
    but JSX is actually one of the things that makes React awesome ðŸ¦„

```jsx
// regular function
function Greeting() {
  const name = "Jamal"
  return ( // Return JSX
      <View>
        <Text>Hello, {name}</Text> {/* Anything inside {} will execute as JS */}
      </View>
  )
}
```
