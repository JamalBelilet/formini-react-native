Data that comes in from the outside of a component is called
> "props" (properties)

This can be passed
> from a parent to a child through JSX attributes

Props come into function components as
> the first argument to the function.

```jsx
// Props as the first argument to the function
function Greeting(props) {
  return (
      <View>
        <Text>Hello, {props.name}</Text>
      </View>
  )
}

// Set a prop on a child component by passing an attribute
export default function App() {
    return (
        <View>
            <Greeting name="Jamal" />
            <Text>Minim id sint do labore.</Text>
        </View>
    )
}
```
